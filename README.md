Toy Robot Simulator 
==========================

## Description:

The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop, of dimensions 5 units x 5 units. There are no other obstructions on the table surface. The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be prevented from falling to destruction. Any movement that would result in the robot falling from the table must be prevented, however further valid movement commands must still be allowed.

## Usage

To start the application, call

    $ ./bin/toy-robot
    
Type `help` to get a summary of available commands. Type `help <command>` to get help on a specific command. Type `exit` or `quit` to quit the toy-robot console. 

The console also supports history and recursive history search (<ctrl> + r).

Although the specifications mention only capitalized commands, the application also accepts commands in lowercase.

The application can read in commands of the following form:

    PLACE 2,3,WEST
    MOVE
    LEFT
    RIGHT
    REPORT

- PLACE will put the toy robot on the table in position X,Y and facing NORTH,
  SOUTH, EAST or WEST.
- The origin (0,0) can be considered to be the SOUTH WEST most corner.
- The first valid command to the robot is a PLACE command, after that, any
  sequence of commands may be issued, in any order, including another PLACE
  command. The application should discard all commands in the sequence until
  a valid PLACE command has been executed.
- MOVE will move the toy robot one unit forward in the direction it is
  currently facing.
- LEFT and RIGHT will rotate the robot 90 degrees in the specified direction
  without changing the position of the robot.
- REPORT will announce the X,Y and F of the robot. This can be in any form,
  but standard output is sufficient.
- A robot that is not on the table can choose the ignore the MOVE, LEFT, RIGHT
  and REPORT commands.
- Input can be from a file, or from standard input, as the developer chooses.
- Provide test data to exercise the application.

## Running the specs

Just call rspec from the application directory:
